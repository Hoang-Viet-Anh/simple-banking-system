# Simple Banking System
JetBrains Academy. Project: Simple Banking System. </br></br>
Everything goes digital these days, and so does money.
Today, most people have credit cards, which save us time, energy and nerves.
From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways.
In this project, I developed a simple banking system with database.</br></br>
Jar file is located by <b>./Simple Banking System/task/build/libs</b>.</br>
In order to run the file you need to pass 2 arguments "-fileName" and "databaseName.s3db"</br>
"databaseName.s3db" is sqlite db file, use exist file or enter new file name that application will generate.</br>
All data will be stored in that file.
